A pretty buns games I made in Godot for A-level NEA. Heavily based on "Library of Ruina", with a focus on users making their own content.
I don't even know if this belongs on Github, I've never really actually used Github before aside from occasionally downloading some tools from it and one time I uploaded a single other file.
Although I have that "DefaultUserFolder" thing in here, I don't actually pack that with the rest of the resources, I just include a copy of it along with the compiled game and packed resources. Its contents just get copied over to godot's user folder in appdata as a sort of like initial state for it.
There's some useful stuff in the Content folder, particularly the StuffForMakingCustomContent since that folder is literally dedicated to helping the users with precisely that, there's a little info panel in the game to guide them to it.
Since I'm not exactly the creative type, pretty much all the assets in the Content folder are stolen from the Library of Ruina itself for the time being. I've shared this project with my friends in the hopes that they might make some stuff for it I can use as replacement, but I won't get my hopes up too much.
Not much of interest in all this source stuff really, you can download the compiled thing and mess around with it if you want though.
